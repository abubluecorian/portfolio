 <h1>
    Working With Conditional statements 
 </h1>

    
 <article>

 In this reading, you will learn when to use the if else statement and when to use the switch statement.

Both if else and switch are used to determine the program execution flow based on whether or not some conditions have been met.

This is why they are sometimes referred to as flow control statements. In other words, they control the flow of execution of your code, so that some code can be skipped, while other code can be executed.

At the heart of both flow control structures lies the evaluation of one or more conditions.

Generally, if else is better suited if there is a binary choice in the condition.

For example, in plain English: if it's sunny, wear sunglasses. Otherwise, don't.

In this case, using an if statement is an obvious choice.

When there are a smaller number of possible outcomes of truthy checks, it is still possible to use an if else statement, such as:

    Copy these code and run in the console and ENJOY!
</h2>
<strong>
    IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT = and == are totally different things in JavaScript "=" assigns a value whereas ""=="" loosely comparision operator.
</strong>
<code>   <pre>var light = "green";
        if(light == "green") {
            console.log("Drive")
        } else if (light == "orange") {
            console.log("Get ready")
        } else if (light == "red") {
            console.log("Dont' drive")
        } else {
            //this block will run if no condition matches
            console.log("The car is not green, orange, or red");
        } 
    </pre></code>
<h3> Using switch statements </h3>
    <article>
        However, if there are a lot of possible outcomes, it is best practice to use a switch statement because it is easier less verbose. Being easier to read, it is easier to follow the logic, and thus reduce cognitive load of reading multiple conditions.

Nevertheless, this is not a rule set in stone. It is simply a stylistic choice.

To reinforce this point, here's an example of the earlier if else conditional statement, using the switch syntax: 
    </article>


    <code>
        <pre>
            //converting the previous if-else example with switch-case
            var light = "green";
            switch(light) {
               case 'green':
                   console.log("Drive");
                   break;
               case 'orange':
                   console.log("Get ready");
                   break;
               case 'red':
                   console.log("Don't drive");
                   break;
               default:
                   //this block will run if no condition matches
                   console.log('The light is not green, orange, or red');
                   break;
            } 
        </pre>
    </code>
    <strong>
      More examples of switch </strong>
<ol>
 
       <li>
        Code the days of the week program as a switch statement
       </li>
<li>
    On the next line, define a new variable, name it day, and set its value to "Sunday".
</li>
<li>
    Start coding a switch statement, passing the day variable as the expression to evaluate.
</li>

<li>
    Inside the switch, add cases for every day of the week, starting with 'Monday', and ending with 'Sunday'. Make sure to use string values for days. Inside each case, for now, just add a console.log('Do something'), and add a break; on the line below.
</li>

<li>
    At the very bottom of the switch statement, add the default case and add a console.log('There is no such day').
</li>



<li>

Finally, update the console.log calls for each case, based on whatever activity you have on each of the days.

// If you need to make sure that multiple conditions are true in an if statement, you can do so using the && operator

Conditional statements

In JavaScript, there is also a shorthand version of writing a conditional statement, known as the conditional (ternary) operator:
