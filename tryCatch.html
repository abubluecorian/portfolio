Recognize common types of errors in JavaScript

Here are some of the most common errors in JavaScript: 

ReferenceError 

SyntaxError 

TypeError 

RangeError

There are some other errors in JavaScript. These other errors include: 

AggregateError 

Error 

InternalError 

URIError

However, in this reading I'll focus on the Reference, Syntax, Type, and Range errors.

ReferenceError
A ReferenceError gets thrown when, for example, one tries to use variables that haven't been declared anywhere.

An example can be, say, attempting to console log a variable that doesn't exist:
    </article>
    <strong>
        Note: Please copy the code and run in console to see the output
    </strong>
    <code>
        console.log(username); 
    </code>
