By the end of this reading, you'll be able to:

Recognize common types of errors in JavaScript

Here are some of the most common errors in JavaScript: 

ReferenceError 

SyntaxError 

TypeError 

RangeError

There are some other errors in JavaScript. These other errors include: 

AggregateError 

Error 

InternalError 

URIError

However, in this reading I'll focus on the Reference, Syntax, Type, and Range errors.

ReferenceError
A ReferenceError gets thrown when, for example, one tries to use variables that haven't been declared anywhere.

An example can be, say, attempting to console log a variable that doesn't exist:
    </article>
    <strong>
        Note: Please copy the code and run in console to see the output
    </strong>
    <code>
        <pre>
            console.log(username); 
        </pre>
     
    </code>
    <strong>
        If the variable named username hasn't been declared, the above line of code will result in the following output:
    </strong>
    <code>
        <pre>
            Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined
        </pre>
    </code>
    <h3>
        SyntaxError

    </h3>
    <strong>
        Any kind of invalid JavaScript code will cause a SyntaxError. <hr>


For example:
    </strong>
    <code>
        <pre>
            var a "there's no assignment operator here"; <br>
            The above line of code will throw the following error:   <br>
        <blockquote>   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string </blockquote> 
        </pre>
    </code>
    <strong>
        Note: - There's an interesting caveat regarding the SyntaxError in JavaScript: it cannot be caught using the try-catch block.  
    </strong>
    <h3>
        TypeError
   
    </h3>
    <p>
        A TypeError is thrown when, for example, trying to run a method on a non-supported data type. <hr>

        
        A simple example is attempting to run the pop() method on a string: 
    </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
            "hello".pop() // Uncaught TypeError: "hello".pop is not a function
        </pre>
    </code>

    <h3>
        RangeError

    </h3>
<p>
    A RangeError is thrown when we're giving a value to a function, but that value is out of the allowed range of acceptable input values.

Here's a simple example of converting an everyday Base 10 number (a number of the common decimal system) to a Base 2 number (i.e binary number).
<br>
For example:
</p>
<code>
    <pre>
        (10).toString(2); // '1010'
    </pre>
</code>
<p>
    The value of 2 when passed to the toString() method, is like saying to JavaScript: "convert the value of 10 of the Base 10 number system, to its counter-part in the Base 2 number system".
<br>
JavaScript obliges and "translates" the "regular" number 10 to its binary counter-part.

Besides using Base 2 number system, I can also use the Base 8, like this:
</p>
<code>
    <pre>
        (10).toString(8); // 12
    </pre>
</code>
<p>
    I get back the value 12, which is the plain number 10, writen in Base 8 number system.

    However, if I try to use a non-existing number system, such as an imaginary Base 100, since this number system effectively doesn't exist in JavaScript, I will get the RangeError,
     because a non-existing Base 100 system is <b> out of range</b>  of the number systems that are available to the toString() method: 
</p>
<code>
    <pre>
        (10).toString(100); // Uncaught RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36
    </pre>
</code>
