By the end of this reading, you'll be able to:

Recognize common types of errors in JavaScript

Here are some of the most common errors in JavaScript: 

ReferenceError 

SyntaxError 

TypeError 

RangeError

There are some other errors in JavaScript. These other errors include: 

AggregateError 

Error 

InternalError 

URIError

However, in this reading I'll focus on the Reference, Syntax, Type, and Range errors.

ReferenceError
A ReferenceError gets thrown when, for example, one tries to use variables that haven't been declared anywhere.

An example can be, say, attempting to console log a variable that doesn't exist:
    </article>
    <strong>
        Note: Please copy the code and run in console to see the output
    </strong>
    <code>
        <pre>
            console.log(username); 
        </pre>
     
    </code>
    <strong>
        If the variable named username hasn't been declared, the above line of code will result in the following output:
    </strong>
    <code>
        <pre>
            Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined
        </pre>
    </code>
    <h3>
        SyntaxError

    </h3>
    <strong>
        Any kind of invalid JavaScript code will cause a SyntaxError. <hr>


For example:
    </strong>
    <code>
        <pre>
            var a "there's no assignment operator here"; <br>
            The above line of code will throw the following error:   <br>
        <blockquote>   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string </blockquote> 
        </pre>
    </code>

</body>
