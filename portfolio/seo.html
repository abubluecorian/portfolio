<h1>SEO Keywords</h1>
   

    <h2>What are SEO Keywords?</h2>
    <p>SEO keywords (also known as “keywords” or “keyphrases”) are terms added to online content in order to improve search engine rankings for those terms. Most keywords are discovered during the keyword research process and are chosen based on a combination of search volume, competition, and commercial intent.</p>

    <h2>Why are SEO Keywords Important?</h2>
    <p>When you optimize your content around words and phrases that people search for, your website can rank higher for those terms. Ranking higher in the SERPs can drive more targeted traffic to your website, making finding keywords a crucial step in any SEO campaign.</p>

    <p>In fact, SEO is pretty much impossible without keywords. Having a list of the right keywords allows you to work on important SEO tasks such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Figuring out your site architecture</li>
        <li>Planning out product and category pages</li>
        <li>Writing content for blog posts and YouTube videos</li>
        <li>Optimizing landing pages and sales pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With that, here’s how to find keywords for SEO.</p>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p><strong>Use Google Suggest</strong></p>

    <p>Many people struggle with SEO because they target keywords that are WAY too competitive. I recommend focusing on long-tail keywords, which are long (usually 4+ word) terms that searchers use in Google and other search engines. Long tails tend to have a lower keyword difficulty compared to 1-3 word “head terms”.</p>

    <p>For people who are new to SEO, long tails are usually the best keywords to start with. Fortunately, finding long-tail terms is a breeze thanks to Google Suggest (also known as Google Autocomplete).</p>

    <p>For example, let’s say you wanted to create a page about “keto lunch”. Well, if your site is new, the keyword “keto lunch” is probably too competitive. But when you type keto lunch into Google, you get a list of long-tail keyword suggestions.</p>
