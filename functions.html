   <h3>Building and calling functions </h3> 
In this reading, you will learn how to build and call a function. The purpose of this reading is to provide you with an example of function declaration (build) and function invocation (call). In the next lesson you will be writing the code.

By the end of this reading you should be able to:

Code simple functions that can accept an array and iterate through it  

Let's start with giving our function declaration a name:
<code>
    function listArrayItems(arr) {
        // ... code to be added ...
    } 
</code>
<p>
    So, I've declared a listArrayItems function, and I've set it up to accept a single parameter, arr - which stands for an array.

Now, I'll need to code a for loop to loop over an array.

As covered in previous lessons in this course, a for loop needs the following information: 

1. the starting loop counter value as a temporary variable i 

2. the exit condition (the maximum value of the loop counter variable i, above which the loop no longer runs) 

3. how to update the value of i after each loop

Here's the information I'll use in this function declaration: 1. The loop's starting counter will be 0. The reason for setting it to zero is due to the fact that arrays are also counted from zero. 

This means that I'll have a one-to-one mapping of the current value of the i variable at any given time, corresponding to the same index position of any item in the arr array 2. 

The for loop's exit condition is when the value of i is equal or greater than arr.length. 

Since the arr.length counts the number of items in the array from one, and the array items are indexed from zero, this effectively means that as soon as i is equal to arr.length, the loop will finish and any other code after it will be run. 

This practically means that the exit condition for this for loop will be i < arr.length returning false. 

In other words, as long as i < arr.length is true, this for loop will continue to run. 3. To make sure that none of the items in the arr array are skipped, I have to increase the value of i by 1 after each loop.

Now that I know exactly how my for loop should behave, I can add it to my listArrayItems() function:
</p>
<code>
    function listArrayItems(arr) {
        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // ... code pending here ...
        }
    }
</code>
<h3>
    The most Tricky letter finder Function
</h3>
<code>
    function letterFinder(word, match) {
        for(var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            if(word[i] == match) {
                //check if the current characater, word[i], is equal to the match
                console.log('Found the', match, 'at', i)
            } else {
                console.log('---No match found at', i)
            }
        }
    }
    
    letterFinder("test", "t")
    
</code>
<strong>
    output:
</strong>
<code>
    ---No match found at 0
Found the a at 1
---No match found at 2
---No match found at 3
---No match found at 4
Found the a at 5
</code>
<strong>
    Here the paramete 1 is test (which is word ) and para,eter 2 is t which is a letter so the function here is finding  the letter "t" is in which place of word "test"
</strong>
